All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 19-20 at Berkeley.
We give first preference to Berkeley graduate students, postdocs,
and researchers so you're at the top of the waitlist. In general
there is often a lot of flux in the registration up through the day
before the bootcamp, so I think it's likely that many of you will
be able to attend, but I may not be able to let you know until
the week of the bootcamp. 

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using this link
(goo.gl/8iXTWr) so we can
accommodate as many people as possible.

Thanks,
Chris Paciorek
