# r-bootcamp-2017
SCF/D-Lab R bootcamp at UC Berkeley, August 2017

The bootcamp webpage with logistics details is on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2017/rbootcamp2017/home). If you're not able to get access, try logging into Piazza using your Berkeley email/credentials, and failing that, please email r-bootcamp@lists.berkeley.edu.

For the schedule, see *schedule/schedule.pdf*. For the presentation materials (including embedded demo code), see the html files in *modules*. The *_slides_* files have individual pages, while the other html files are one continuous page per module. To run the demo code, open the .Rmd file for the module in RStudio. You can then run individual chunks of code.
